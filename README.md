## Portfolio Site
This is my personal portfolio site hosted on GitHub Pages. 

On commit to master, custom GitHub Action kicks in, builds the project and serves it on GitHub pages using ```crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v1```. For develop builds, I set up Vercel app to perform automated deployments to non-prod environments.

This project is built with React and MUI.

Current roadmap:
- [x] Core template
- [x] Image grids and lightbox
- [x] Responsive Layout
- [x] CMS
- [ ] SEO
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Seamless Transitions between pages
- [ ] UI modules for showcasing specific media
- [ ] More content!
